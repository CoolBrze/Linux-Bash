## The purpose of this script is to archive and zip a collection of files with a common prefix and move them to a directory.
## EXAMPLE: If an application creates subsequent log files from [logfile] with the convention [logfile.01], [logfile.02] .... [logfile.10] you should select a trigger file, say [logfile.10].
##          You will then set the FILE variable to PATH/[logfile.10]. You will also need to assign a common prefix to the variable LOG_FILES, so that the script will know which files to archive (for example LOG_FILES=[logfile.])
##          Finally, you will select a directory to move the zipped/archived file with the LOG_LOCATION variable
